# Redesign of SynapseGrid

In order to bring SynapseGrid up to date, it seems to be 
better to reimplement core of the library from scratch.
Benefits:
- rethinking all design decisions and make
new decision using the knowledge that we have at 
this moment;
- taking care about type safety from the very beginning,
- designing with extensions in mind - 
distributed, typed, nested, actors,... 
- keeping good parts
