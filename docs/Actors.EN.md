Multithreading support
======================

SinapseGrid has a perfect integration with the awesome Akka library. (By the way, I'd like to acknowledge Jonas Bon√©r and Martin Odersky  creating this library.)


System capabilities (SinapseGrid)
----------------------------------------------
1. Parallel data processing
2. Explicit declaration, which subsystems will be executed in separate actor.


System capabilities (Akka Actor system pov)
------------------------------------------------
1. System structure observation, via autogenerated Dot-graphs
2. Multiinput actors.
3. Actor's output data..


On schedule
-----------
1. Exception processing strategy,
2. Actor/subsystem pool


Akka Actors usage
---------------------------
All systems, that were described above, are single-threaded. So, there are many possible ways to jump for multithreading.
One of them by creating actor-based system, that will be fully compatible with Akka.
When Actor receive a Signal message, it's processing will be performed in the most obvious way: signal will be sent next, to embedded DynamicSystem.
There's a special NonSignalWithSenderInput contact. It could be used for compatibility with programs, that doesn't work with Signals.
This contact has (ActorRef, Any) type. The first element will contain received data sender, the second, strictly speaking - data.
