Multithreading support
======================

SynapseGrid has a perfect integration with the awesome Akka library. (By the way, I'd like to acknowledge Jonas Bonér and Martin Odersky  creating this library.)


System capabilities (SynapseGrid)
----------------------------------------------
1. Parallel data processing
2. Explicit declaration, which subsystems will be executed in separate actor.


System capabilities (Akka Actor system pov)
------------------------------------------------
1. System structure observation, via autogenerated Dot-graphs
2. Multiinput actors.
3. Actor's output data..


On schedule
-----------
1. Exception processing strategy,
2. Actor/subsystem pool


Akka Actors usage
---------------------------
All, described above, systems are single-threaded. There are also many possible ways to achieve multithreading.
One of them – create an actor-based system, that will be fully compatible with Akka.
When Actor receives a Signal message, then it will be proceed in the most obvious way: signal will be sent next to embedded DynamicSystem.

The NonSignalWithSenderInput contact can be used for compatibility with programs, which doesn't support Signals.
This contact has (ActorRef, Any) type. It's first element will contain received data sender, the second – data..
